# Math Adventures — AI-Powered Adaptive Learning Prototype

## Overview
A minimal adaptive-learning prototype for children (ages 5–10) practicing basic math. The system generates puzzles, tracks correctness and time, and adapts difficulty either via a rule-based engine or a small optional ML model.

## Repo structure
